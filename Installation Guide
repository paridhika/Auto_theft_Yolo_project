#Install Python:# Python usually comes pre-installed on MacOS and most Linux distributions. You can verify the installation by running python --version in the terminal (note that depending on how Python is installed, you might have to use python3 instead of python throughout these steps).

Ensure you have installed Python 3.10 or higher. If you do not have it installed, you can download it from python.org.

Create a Virtual Environment: Open Terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then create a virtual environment using:


python -m venv gradio-env
Note: you can choose a different name than gradio-env for your virtual environment in this step.

Activate the Virtual Environment: To activate the virtual environment on MacOS/Linux, use:


source gradio-env/bin/activate
Install Gradio: With the virtual environment activated, install Gradio using pip:


pip install gradio
Verification: To verify the installation, run python and then type:


import gradio as gr
print(gr.__version__)
This will display the installed version of Gradio.
